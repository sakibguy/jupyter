## Purpose

Think of it as a monthly, virtual JupyterCon. Itâ€™s a place to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/reviving-the-all-jupyter-team-meetings/423).

## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make short announcements (without a need for discussion). 

* **Isabela** We've officially hit two years of consecutive Jupyter community calls! Thank you all for supporting our community.
* **Nick** Recent [release of traitlets](https://blog.jupyter.org/announcing-a-new-jupyter-governance-model-and-our-first-executive-council-39b3989dc064) supports tab completion
* **Gayle** [Blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/announcing-a-new-jupyter-governance-model-and-our-first-executive-council-39b3989dc064) about Jupyter governance launch

## Agenda Items

Add agenda items here **before** the meeting. We will reorganize the agenda so that it fits in the 60m meeting slot.

* **Stephen Macke**: [IPyflow](https://github.com/ipyflow/ipyflow): a dataflow-aware Python kernel for JupyterLab
* **Nick Bollweg**: [jyg](https://github.com/deathbeds/jyg): run JupyterLab commands from the CLI... or other browser windows
* **Gayle**: [Jupytercon](https://www.jupytercon.com/)! How would you promote the event? Reach out at gayle@numfocus.org
* **Kafonek**: Are any Jupyter-collaborative meetings (Y-py, etc) still going on? Have tried to connect to those communities and had trouble. Also would like to push for pypi to host wasm wheels.
